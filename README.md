# Calculator

We are thrilled to announce the highly anticipated release of Console App version 3.0, the final and most feature-rich version of our application. This release brings a plethora of improvements, new functionalities, and enhanced user experience.

Have a look at `Program.cs` file and you can see how I have used:

1. Console input/output =>

2. Arithmetic operation with switch expression =>

3. Ternery operator =>

4. Foor Loop =>

5. `try`, `catch` =>

6. `Methods` => I create several **_methods_** and programm refactored with these methods.

    * Creating method:

    * Calling method:

        ![image](./Assets/method2.png)

7. `Class` => I create three class and move all `methods` into these classes. As a result, I managed to make 177 lines of code into 25 lines. But the function of the program has not changed at all.

8. Result =>
